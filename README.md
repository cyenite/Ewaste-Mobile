# E-waste Collection App

An android application developed using the **Flutter** framework, designed to streamline and manage e-waste collection.

## Description

In our tech-driven world, electronic waste (or e-waste) management is a growing concern. The E-waste Collection App is an innovative solution that brings convenience and efficiency to e-waste collection and management. 

Here's a detailed overview of the app's processes:

1. **User Registration**: The app provides a user-friendly registration process where users can sign up, providing their location details and contact information.
2. **E-waste Cataloging**: Users can catalog their e-waste by entering details like type (e.g., phone, computer, etc.), brand, and condition. Photos can also be added for better clarity.
3. **Scheduling Pickups**: Once e-waste is cataloged, users can schedule a pickup. The app will suggest the nearest e-waste collection agency or volunteer.
4. **Tracking & Notifications**: After scheduling a pickup, users can track the status of their e-waste collection in real-time. They will also receive notifications regarding pickup status and any changes.
5. **E-waste Processing Information**: Post-collection, users will be informed about the processing of their e-waste - whether it's refurbished, recycled, or disposed of safely.
6. **Eco-rewards**: To incentivize users for responsible e-waste management, the app offers eco-rewards that can be redeemed for discounts or services.
